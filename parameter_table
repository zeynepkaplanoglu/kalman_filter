```
t = linspace(0,100,1001);%Discrete times from 1 to 100 for time t

%model a moving object that follows a simple path as given in the following function:
pos = 0.1*(t.^2-t);


sz = size(pos); %the variable named sz takes "position matrix" (pos) size
meas = zeros(sz(2),1); %zeros vector of size 101x1 is created by using sz variable to initialize measurement vector

for i=1:sz(2)
    meas(i) = pos(i) + (rand(1)-0.5)*500; 
end

% previously created empty measurement vector, meas, is filled in the above
% for loop
% meas vector is based upon "position vector" (pos). In each iteration a
% random value is added to value of position vector corresponding
% measurement value. 

%plot(t,pos) %position value vs dicrete time plot

dt = 0.1; %discrete time value
sigma_acc = 0.25; %standard devitaion of acceleration
sigma_meas = 1.2; %standard deviation of measurement
